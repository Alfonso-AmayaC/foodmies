## How to run this project

This project requires a minimal configuration. Create a .env file at the root of the project './' where it contains the mongodb connection uri. 

**Important: the mongodb cluster should contain a database called "pantry" and a collection called "fruits", if you need a ready-to-go mongodb test URI contact me via my mail: [alfonsocamargo0108@gmail.com](mailto:alfonsocamargo0108@gmail.com)**

```console
yarn dev
```
